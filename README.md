### Final Year Project for Diploma in Information Technology

Clubs and societies play a crucial role in a studentâ€™s journey as they offer significant benefits such as learning new skills and forming valuable friendships. However, the process of participating in clubs and societies is often inefficient and inconvenient as it involves many different mediums and platforms leading to disorganisation and tedious repetition. Thus, a single unified platform is proposed to simplify the process and streamline the flow of participating in clubs and societies for students.

- Obtain complete information about clubs and societies
- Send enquiries to clubs and societies
